 == HEXINJECT ==

HexInject is a very versatile packet injector and sniffer,
that provide a command-line framework for raw network access.

It's designed to work together with others command-line utilities,
and for this reason it facilitates the creation of powerful shell scripts
capable of reading, intercepting and modifying network traffic in a transparent manner.

 == TOOLS ==

hexinject:
The main sniffer and injector.

prettypacket:
Disassemble raw packets (received on its standard input) and print their field.
Can also print example packets (useful if you want to know the structure of an header).

hex2raw:
Convert hexstring (the textual format used by hexinject) to raw data,
and vice-versa.

packets.tcl:
Experimental packet forger, written in TCL.
It uses a simple packet representation format based on APD (http://wiki.hping.org/26).

 == COMPILE ==

HexInject is based only on the pcap libraries, so it's should be easy to compile
on systems that supports them.

Dependencies:
libpcap-dev
tcl (for packets.tcl)

Compile:
To compile the tools just type "make" and cross your fingers... :)
